# FoodOrderingApp

This is a food ordering ionic application. It utilizes MongoDB as backend and ionic angular as frontend with typescript.
Between backend and frontend, I use flask to connect, push, and pull request.

In order to run this project, you need to change the url inside the provider. 
The url is in this google colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1g9Gb2kKCdosvqPOCqPnFKqD5ypmnRGRE?usp=sharing
Just run google colab in order to generate a functioning flask url.
